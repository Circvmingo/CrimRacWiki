Exhaust
=======
Goals for Exhaust:
    | Rules Compliance
    | 	Pass sound test at idle and ¾ engine speed
    | 	Meet mounting requirements
    | Manufacturability
    | 	Reduce potential leak points
    | 	Reduce time spent welding
    | Weight Minimization
    | 	Minimize part size while retaining strength requirements
    | Power Output
    | 	Design primary length to maintain power output from previous system
    | 	Reduce backpressure as much as possible 

The current objective for the powerplant system is to improve the engine
output in the range of  8000-11000 RPM due to the current engine gearing
and driver habits.

Overview
--------
**Material Selection**

.. image:: ../all-ppt-images/exhaustmats.png

Factors to consider:
    | - Low-carbon steel is marginally lighter than stainless by density, but is susceptive to corrosion at high temperatures
    | - Aluminum is much lighter than stainless, but will not hold up to exhaust temperatures (~1300º F)
    | - Titanium is half as light as stainless, but twice as expensive



Primary Runners
---------------
Goals for Primaries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Manufactured product that matches CAD
- No leaking from welds and NPT fittings
- Weight stays within 15% of CR21 if muffler can be placed in the center of the car below the engine. If not, decrease system weight by 10%.
- Analysis on GT-Suite comparing different lengths

Pressure Wave Tuning
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Used to determine ideal primary length for a given reflective value

Assumptions
    No change in exhaust temperature
    Full amplitude wave reflection at collector

Primary length:

.. math:: 𝐿=  ((𝐸𝐶𝐷∗𝐶))/(2∗𝑅𝑉∗(6∗𝑅𝑃𝑀))

Speed of sound:

.. math:: 𝐶=√(1.337∗𝑅∗𝑇)

| C=Speed of sound in m/s
| 1.337=specific heat constant at 1000K
| R=Gas constant
| T=Temperature in K

**Design Choice**

Achieves reflective value of 4 for 9000 rpm peak given packaging restraints with a goal of 11.63”

Effective Cam Duration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Primary Geometry
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
| - 1.25” diameter pipe to maintain cross-sectional area between exhaust port and primaries
| - Average length deviation of 0.3” between runners

Mounting Solution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Individual mounting flanges
    | - 19% Total Weight Reduction
    | - Eliminates 16hrs manufacturing time by eliminating need to sand primaries to fit flush with engine


Collector
---------
Welded vs. Slipfit Collector
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Welded
	Not removable
	Requires welds to seal
	Open volume for primaries to dump into
	1.5” collector diameter
	
Slipfit
	Removable 
	Seals by thermal expansion
	Requires springs to retain
	Merge bullet
	2” collector diameter



Secondary Runners
-----------------
Secondary Runner theory
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**Steady state, incompressible flow analysis**

Assumptions
    Constant temperature across secondary
    Incompressible
    Constant mass flow rate

**Principles used:**

Fluid Energy Equation:

.. math:: (𝑃_1/𝛾)+𝛼(𝑉_1^2/2𝑔)+ℎ_𝑝=(𝑃_2/𝛾)+𝛼(𝑉_2^2/2𝑔)+ℎ_𝑡+ℎ_𝐿

Law of Conservation of Mass:

.. math:: 𝐴_1 𝑉_1=𝐴_2 𝑉_2

Secondary Runner Design
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
CR20:
    Tapers from 1.5” v-band to 2” secondary
    Muffler mounted via bolted flange

CR21:
    Eliminates taper
    Muffler mounted via v-band
    O2 sensor positioning must be considered
    Calculated reduced backpressure by 3.37kPa (72%)


Muffler
-------

Goals for Muffler
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Pass sound
    Idle@ 103 dbc
    11000@ 110 dbc
Back Pressure
    Utilize a combination of perforated tubes, packing, and chambers
    to ensure a smooth flow path for exhaust gasses. Do not put exhaust
    gas through packing, but use perforated tubes to surround the flow.
Mounting
    Design a way to  mount the muffler so that it does not see a moment
    at the secondary vband (as seen on CR21) and does not interfere with aero
Weight
    Ideally 10% drop in weight from CR21, if not then constant

Muffler Theory
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Absorptive
	Typically heavier due to packing material
	Absorbs sound wave energy and turns into heat
	Lowers sound level at all frequencies
	Simple geometry
	Lower backpressure

Reactive
	Typically lighter
	Targets specific frequencies to reduce sound
	Complex geometry
	Higher backpressure

**Muffler Effective Wavelength**

.. image:: ../all-ppt-images/muffler2.png

Muffler Design
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
| - 1.25 lbs packing and perforated tube to absorb low rpm sound waves
| - 12” section for high rpm wavelength cancellation
| - Large back volume to allow for sound wave reflection back down 12” tube
| - Flowpath is uninterrupted by packing material or baffles
