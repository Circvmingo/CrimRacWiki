Fuel
====
Main goals of fuel:
    | Reliability
    | 	Leak-test fuel system
    | 	Integrate high-pressure PTFE fuel lines
    | Manufacturability
    | 	Minimize cost of materials
    | 	Minimize manufacturing time
    | Weight Minimization
    | 	Consider fuel cell material and wall thickness
    | 	Minimize fuel cell volume
    | Power Output
    | 	Injector characterization 
    | 	Fuel capacity for endurance

Fuel Cell
---------
Goals for Fuel Cell:
    The tank volume will need to be 1.75 gallons (+-0.1 gallons) given
    the fuel issues we had with CR21 endurance. Considerations should
    include hydramat area as well as the CG of the tank. The new tank must
    not be susceptible to cornering as this is a current issue and will
    be more so with greater values of lateral acceleration from wings
    (1.5 Gâ€™s consistently in skid pad with aero). This can be done using
    the hydramat to cover the entirety of the bottom of the tank.

    Reliability: There can be absolutely no leaks from the fuel tank ever.
    The top port (if needed) will need to have a larger area for the sealing surface(s).

Fuel Filler Neck
----------------
Goals for Filler Neck:
    Removable filler neck that complies with all rules and is out of
    view of the driver to reduce the amount of firewalls needed. If
    the filler neck attaches at the bottom of the tank, include a
    breather tube from the top of the tank to the top of the neck to
    allow air to escape when filling. 


Plumbing
--------
Goals for Plumbing:
    All fuel line must be modeled in SolidWorks and must be sourced
    from BMRS. By switching to BMRS line, the system was improved as
    the lines could support a higher pressure, had wear resistant
    braiding, eliminated the need of hose clamps, and reduced the weight
    by 0.256 lbs. Bulkhead fittings are mandatory.

Rubber line was not considered due to reliability issues in the past with sealing and pressure retention

Fuel Rail
---------
Goals for Fuel Rail:
    A new fuel rail will need to be designed. This design needs to
    involve the mounting technique used, pressure sensor location,
    and inlet and outlet ports for the fuel lines. Please factor in
    manufacturability into the design as this is the first time we
    have made a fuel rail in-house. Be sure to match the injector port
    size to the size of the selected injectors we will run.

Modified OEM Rail
	1 hour manufacturing time
	0 Cost
	Stock primary injectors 
Custom Rail
	Estimated 16 hours manufacturing time
	Requires buying stock
	Any choice injector

Injectors
---------
Goals for Injectors:
    An evaluation of injector options should be performed, emphasizing
    max duty cycle, availability of characterization data, and size of
    fuel rail injector ports.
