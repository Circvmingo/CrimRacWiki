Intake
======
.. _Intake:

Main goals of intake:
    | Maintain serviceability, increase where possible
    | Improve manufacturability
    | Increase engine output at peak 12000 RPM

The current objectives for the powerplant system is to improve the engine
output in the range of 8000-11000 RPM due to the current engine gearing,
maintain reliability, and improve manufacturing ease and tolerances.

I'm not downloading all of those images elliot. Sorry :/


Components
----------

Air Filter
^^^^^^^^^^

K&N RC 2500 Air Filter

Flow bench data shows that three K&N filters have very similar flow properties,
lightest one was chosen (0.2 vs 0.4 lbs)

Throttle Body
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Goals for Throttle Body
```````````````````````
\- Proper incorporation of the Bosch 40 mm electronic throttle body
and mechanical throttle body and freedom with the use of a Wiggin’s
clamp at the base of the restrictor.

Restrictor
^^^^^^^^^^
\- Analysis must be completed with regards to diffuser length and its
effect on pressure recovery as well as varying throat geometry and location
along the length of the duct. Results must show a comparison of hand
calculations, CFD results, and flow bench results.

| **Theoretical mass flow when choked:**
| 0.0769 kg/s

.. math:: 𝑚𝑑𝑜𝑡=  (𝑃_0 (𝑎^∗))/√(𝑇_0 )∗√(Ɣ/𝑅(〖2/(Ɣ+1))〗^((Ɣ+1)/(Ɣ−1)) )

| 𝑃\ :sub:`0`\  is inlet pressure
| 𝑎\ :sup:`*`\  is throat area
| 𝑇\ :sub:`0`\  is inlet temperature
| Ɣ is gamma of the fluid
| R is the universal gas constant

CFD Run Conditions:
    | •Energy equation used
    | •K-epsilon Turbulence model
    | •Density based
    | •Axisymmetric
    | •Pressure inlet 
    |  •101,300 KPa
    |  •300 K
    | •Pressure outlet
    |   •12.5 KPa gauge pressure
    |   •300 K
    | •Ideal gas
    | •Boundary conditions
    |   •Wall
    |   •Axis
    |   •Inlet 
    |   •outlet

Plenum
^^^^^^
.. image:: ../all-ppt-images/plenum.png

Goals for Plenum
````````````````
\- In an effort to reduce weight and lower powertrain cg 
the plenum should be made from carbon fiber. Alternatively, 3d printing is an option.

Runners
^^^^^^^
| Length determined with Matlab wave tuning script
|   •Target 12000 RPM
|   •Speed of sound calculation
|       •Fluid properties pulled from drive data

.. math:: L = (EffectiveCamDuration*C) /(RPM*RV*2*6)

.. image:: ../all-ppt-images/Runners1.jpg


Goals for Runners
`````````````````
\- Bellmouth design needs to be re-evaluated and confirmed using both
CFD and physicaltesting on a flow bench.

\- The taper of the runners needs to be evaluated from both a performance
and manufacturing standpoint and tested on a flow bench.
