Differential
============

Goals for Differential
----------------------

Spool vs. Drexler
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Look at laptimes and corner exit speeds of the open diff, and the
Drexler with various levels of preload, at fully locked levels of
preload is the car noticeably slower? If not look at potential
costs of keeping a spool and the effect in team workload
associated with it. Once you have a design, be sure to validate it
using FEA.

CV Joints
^^^^^^^^^
One of the areas where we can see a potential decrease in rotating
mass is the CV Joints. Noah wrote a code for it last year. Get the
code from him and see if any reductions can be made based on this
code. If reductions can be made a wire edm sponsorship will need
to be found.

Weight
^^^^^^
Further analysis into the loading and fatigue effects on this system
are needed before weight reduction goals can be set. Instead aim for
no weight increases.
