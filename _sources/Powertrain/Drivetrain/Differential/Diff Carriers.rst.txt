Diff Carriers
=============

Goals for Diff Carriers
-----------------------
In order to facilitate tuning of the differential and improve
serviceability the differential must be easily removable. Use
your best judgement in the best way to achieve this goal; in the
past we have used tabs on the frame which the carriers bolt to,
as well as engine pins that go through the carriers themselves.
I would also like to see a tensioning system for the chain. We
had to remake the carriers 7 times this past year so a tensioner
should fix our issue. The carriers have had issues in the past
with sims that do not converge. Figure out where this issue is
coming from.


Master Carrier
--------------
Master Accel
^^^^^^^^^^^^
Load Case comes from a 1.5 G acceleration

Load (Acceleration): 
    Radially : 3024 lbf (due to Acceleration) 
    Axially : 26.76 lbf (due to bearings holders) 

Yield Stress: 
    39 ksi 

Boundaries:
    Fixed Hinge on mounting points
    Roller/Slider on engine pin and frame contact areas

Material: 
    6061 Aluminum-T6

Master Decel
^^^^^^^^^^^^
Load Case comes from a 0.4 G Engine braking case

Load (Deceleration): 
    Radially : 920 lbf (due to engine braking) 
    Axially : 26.76 lbf (due to bearings holders) 

Yield Stress: 
    39 ksi 

Boundaries:
    Fixed Hinge on mounting points
    Roller/Slider on engine pin and frame contact areas

Material: 
    6061 Aluminum-T6
