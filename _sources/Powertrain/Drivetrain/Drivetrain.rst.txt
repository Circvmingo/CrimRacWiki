Main goals of drivetrain:
    | Serviceability
    | Weight Savings
    | Durability and reliability
    | Minimize variation
    | Finish endurance

Overall Drivetrain Goals:
    - Determine load at peak torque.
    - Determine load at peak torque+launch
    - Determine load at max acceleration seen in previous years
    - Effects of fatigue need to be considered




Bearings
--------
Bearing Goals:
    - Bearing selection must consist of friction analysis on different bearings to reduce parasitic drivetrain losses.
    - Tolerance study, least amount of power loss
