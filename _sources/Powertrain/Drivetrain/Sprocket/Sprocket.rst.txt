Sprocket Goals
--------------
    In order to reduce the movement away from concentricity due to
    loading when a torque from the engine is applied to the
    differential which would cause an increase in frictional losses,
    the maximum deformation of the differential must be less than or
    equal to .0125‚Äù from the center of the front sprocket at peak
    loading. Show this with the use of  FEA. There is also a chance
    that we will be able to attach strain gauges to the differential
    carriers. This will be a good way to validate their design.
