Lubrication
===========
Goals for Lubrication:
    | Minimize system weight and complexity
    | Provide adequate lubrication performance
    | Allow optimal engine placement

Parts Overview
--------------
- Wet Sump
- Oil Pan
- Oil Pickup
- Trap Door System
- Windage Tray
- Drain Plug / Thermistor Bung
- Dry Sump
- Oil Pan
- Oil Lines
- Oil de-aerator/reservoir
- Oil Selection


Gasket
------
| ● Dry gasket reduces service time and complexity
| ● One-piece fiber reinforced Nitrile gasket eliminates need for sealant
| ● Waterjetted for precision fitment and reproducibility

Oil pan
-------
Oil Pan Goals:
    Creates a proper seal, while maintaining light weight and ease of
    manufacturing. Incorporate jigs into the manufacturing process in
    order to meet designed tolerances.

| ● 6061 Aluminum, formed and welded
| ● Integrated baffle tray
| ● Temperature sensor serves as drain plug
| ● 0.86L volume, 1.56L system total
| ● New, low profile design allows engine CG to be lowered by 1.6cm.

Trap Door System
----------------
Trap Door Goals:
    Investigate different designs for the trap door system that can make
    the part easier to service. Talk to Eddie about the possibility of
    developing a sloshing simulation of the oil pan. 

Oil Pickup
----------
Oil Pickup Goals:
    Design an oil pickup that effectively does its job and is easy to manufacture.

| ● 6061 Aluminum
| ● Easy to manufacture
| ● Seals with OE pickup tube gasket
| ● Optimized geometry to prevent oil starvation

Baffle Tray
-----------
| ● Proven design prevents oil starvation during maximum cornering force
| ● Triple Trap Door 
| ● Retained by welded tabs

Oil Selection
-------------
Oil Selection Goals:
    Select an oil that will adequately protect the engine from wear.
    Talk to Hunter about the possible Valvoline sponsorship and the
    selections of oils they have to offer. 

Mobil 1 4T 10W-40
    | ● Cost efficient 
    | ● Available locally
    | ● Wet clutch specific additives 
    | ● Meets Yamahas recommended oil specifications.
    | ● Proven through oil analysis to withstand the harshest conditions our car can provide

Oil Heat Load
-------------
Oil Heat Load Goals:
    Use the engine dyno to characterize how much of a heat load the
    engine puts on the lubrication system. In order to do this, it
    will be possible to run the engine at peak horsepower for a
    certain amount of time without the cooling system running and
    determine the rate of oil temperature increase from data.
    Obviously, we would not let the oil get past 130C, but we could
    use this data to have a better understanding of the heat output
    into the lubrication system and design for this worst-case scenario.
    Then figure out how to mitigate this load by use of coatings or coolers.
