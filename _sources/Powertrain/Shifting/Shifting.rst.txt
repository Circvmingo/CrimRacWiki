Pneumatic System
----------------
Shift Delay
^^^^^^^^^^^
Shift Delay Goals:
    Verify the shift delay duration of the current car using the i2Pro
    software. Maintain the same shift delay as CR21, or lower delay
    time as you see possible. The system on the CR21 has an approximate
    shift delay of 40ms.

Reliability
^^^^^^^^^^^
Reliability Goals:
    The system must have a 99.9% shift to execution.

Weight Reduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Weight Reduction Goals:
    If electronic, weight should decrease more significantly, and we
    would be able to remove the pneumatic lines and tank. Create a
    comparison sheet between electronic and pneumatic to show why you
    chose either one.

Pneumatic Lines
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Pneumatic Lines Goals:
    All lines and fittings must be routed in SolidWorks. Lines can not
    be within 1” of the engine casing or 3” of the exhaust. The bend
    radius of the shifting lines is 4”. Full calculations giving reason
    to air cylinder bore sizing as well as lines inner diameter must
    be shown. Pneumatic cylinder sizing is one of the last areas that
    show potential for significant improvement.
    
    Creating a test bench, along with some sort of mathematical
    model(excel, matlab, Simulink)  might also lead to potential gains.

Electronic Shifting
-------------------
Electronic shifting has many benefits if we’re able to get it to work properly.

1.	Get rid of the need of a pneumatic system, including tank refills
2.	No longer need to worry about lines bursting
3.	More control over shifting force than just full on or full off
4.	Can potentially introduce more sophisticated logic to handle dog-to-dog events, etc. Might be able to increase shift reliability.
5.	Might be able to use PID control to shift more efficiently
6.	Use of encoder on motor to determine if a shift was completed or not

Noah messed around with an RS755, as well as a 64:1 gearbox. In
addition, you could use a Vex Robotics Talon SRX motor controller,
as it can be controlled over CAN. This would allow us to handle all
of the logic using the MoTeC M150, instead of an external
controller. This would require the use of M1 Build.

A Test bench must be made before implementation on a car.

A custom shift drum has the potential to lower the learning curve
of new drivers as well as let the drives and the team reliably put
the car in neutral. A custom shift drum also has the potential of
increasing shift reliability by removing the need to pass through
neutral on the 1-2 shift.

Currently the shift pattern in 1-N-2-3-4-5-6. Investigate the
possibility of moving neutral to the bottom. This would make the shift
pattern N-1-2-3-4-5-6. If this is viable do not use aluminum. Auburn
had one very notable example at Lincoln 2019 where their 7075 aluminum
shift drum failed.

A 3d scan of the current shift drum would need to be made for
modification into a new pattern along with possible other changes. We
have access to a 3d faro arm as well as potential access to one in the cube.

Gear Sensing
------------
Currently we use the transmission speed sensor(output shaft angular
velocity) and the engine speed sensor to calculate gear. Because of
this if the vehicle is not moving, gear is unavailable to the driver.
Look into the possibility of putting different resistors on the shift
drum and using the neutral switch as a rotary potentiometer. This
would allow the driver and team to see gear even when at a stop.
