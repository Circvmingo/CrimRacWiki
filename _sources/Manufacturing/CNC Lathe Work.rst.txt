Zeroing tool in Z axis
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Make sure the correct tool is selected and in machine (“spindle” will be shown next to tool the machine thinks is in machine)
- Place Blue Magnetic Block gauge on chuck 
- Handle jog tool end onto silver circle until gauge goes 1 full revolution back to 0
- Move cursor to selected z geometry for the tool in question 
- Click ‘Z face measure’
- This should change the value in orange box

Zeroing tool in x axis
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Handle jog tool closer to stock until barely scraping while spinning chuck by hand
- Make sure orange box is over the x geometry for tool
- Press ‘X diameter measure’
- Type in measured value (see value under WORK G54)

Screen should look like this
