Parameterization
================

This documentation provides a step-by-step guide on how to perform parameterization in ANSYS Icepak 
within ANSYS Electronics Desktop.

Prerequisites
-------------
Before starting to paramaterize and optimize things, you will need to have:

1. Created the starting geometry for the model
2. Assigned material properties and boundary conditions for the model
3. Created a setup for the initial model


Defining Variables
------------------------
First, we need to define the variables for the project. to do so, go to the Project menu, right click on "Variables", and select
"Add Variable". Give the variable a memorable name, and maybe a description if necessary. Then, set the initial value of the
variable and give it units.


Linking Variables to the Model
-----------------------------------
Find the component or setting you want to parameterize in the Icepak model, then right click and choose "Edit". 

In the edit window, replace the fixed value with the variable name you created earlier, using the format
"${VariableName}" (ex: "${Length}").

Click "OK" to finalize the change.

.. note::
   Make sure to update the model after changing a variable's value to make sure that the changes have actually been applied.


Running the Simulations
-----------------------
The part that really sucks about this is that you will need to run separate simulations manually for different values of the variable,
since there isn't a built-in way to do parametric sweeps in ANSYS Electronics Desktop like there is in Ansys Workbench.

To do this, you need to change the variable's value in the "Variables" section of the "Project" tab. Then, Update the Icepak model to
reflect the new variable value by right-clicking on the model and selecting "Update." Save the model, run the simulation, and note down
important values.
