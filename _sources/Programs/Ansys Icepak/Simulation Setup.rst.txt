Simulation Setup
================

.. _SimSetup:

Simulation Setup is done within the "setup" item under the Simulation banner menu at the top.

After opening the setup menu, you will be presented with four menu options, being General, Convergence, Solver Settings,
and Defaults. The purpose of this page is to provide you with an explanation of each field in these menus, so that you
may gain a greater understanding of how to select the options to best suit each simulation application.

General

Name:
    The name of the current solver you are going to make. The default name is Setup1.

Maximum Number of Iterations:
    This is the max. number of iterations that Fluent will solve. The default value is 100.

Problem Types:
    These are the problems which Icepak will attempt to solve for. For our case, we should leave
    both options checked.

Flow Regime:
    This field determines which solver method the solution will use. Almost never assume laminar flow,
    and instead select the Turbulent option. Then, go into the options menu and select whichever equation
    is best suited for your application. My current understanding is that K-Omega SST will be most used for
    our purposes.

Radiation Model:
    I am unsure of this setting as of now, and I need to do more research to suggest a selection for this option field.

Include Gravity:
    In the case of airflow, it may be best to leave this option unchecked. However, when fluids such as water, coolant, or oil
    are introduced, it may be more reasonable to turn gravity on.

Solve Flow and Energy Equations Sequentially:
    I am unsure of this setting as of now, and I need to do more research to suggest a selection for this option field.

Convergence

This page allows you to set default solver parameters to speed up your workflow in Icepak.
