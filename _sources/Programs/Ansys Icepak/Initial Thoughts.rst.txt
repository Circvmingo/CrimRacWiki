Initial Thoughts
================

.. _Initial Thoughts:

Main Interface
--------------

This software has the capability to be very powerful. However, the
software is laid out in a rather unintuitive manner. The UI somehow
looks like a worse version of ANSYS SpaceClaim, there are so many
sub-windows covering the screen that the software becomes borderline
unusable, and the viewport navigation is downright atrocious.

Upsides
-------

It isn't all bad, though. There are several upsides to the program, one
of which is that everything is contained within the main program. No need
to bounce around between Workbench, Fluent, Mesher, etc. etc.

Random Notes
============
Total Power is heat generation, not total power draw from battery

need to find thermal efficiency of a battery cell, that way we can figure out how much heat is output
at any given power load

need to figure out how to visually display vents/grilles, as well as the patterns of the grilles

couple pressure and velocity?
