Mesh Generation
===============

.. _MeshGen:

Mesh generation is done within the "Global Mesh Settings" item under the Simulation banner menu at the top.

After opening the global mesh settings menu, you will be presented with three menu options, being General, Advanced,
and Defaults. The purpose of this page is to provide you with an explanation of each field in these menus, so that you
may gain a greater understanding of how to select the options to best suit each simulation application.

Though I will explain the general mesh settings, they are laughably bad and when setting a simulation up, you should almost
always use the advanced settings to your advantage.

General

Name:
    This is where you can name the generated mesh, if you wish.

Auto Mesh Setting:
    As stated previously, this is an atrocious way of actually generating a mesh. if you have any idea at all of what you are doing,
    **DO NOT USE THIS SETTING**. It is simply a slider ranging from a coarse to fine mesh, and gives you no real input over how the
    mesh is actually generated.

Facet Level:
    I have no understanding of this slider as of now, but I will come back and document this at a later time.

Advanced

Maximum Element Size:
    The maximum Element Size items allow you to define the largest an element can be in the X, Y, and Z directions.
    I have never before researched if having a non-cubic max. element size has a benefit, so I will neither reccomend
    nor advise against it.

Minimum Gap:
    My understanding of this setting is that this is where you define the minimum gap on your model. However, I am unsure
    of if that is at all correct.

Mesh Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Min. elements in gap:
    This allows you to control the minimum number of elements which it takes to span any given gap in your model.
    As a rule of thumb, this number should be at least 3 to account for the boundary layer present on surfaces.
    By increasing this value, you increase the amount of elements in your mesh, but you also gain accuracy in your solution.

Min. elements on edge:
    this value allows you to change the minimum elements it takes to create an edge. This is mostly up to the geometry of your
    model, but I suggest at minimum 2, and probably closer to 3 or more.

Max size ratio:
    I am unsure of this setting at the current time, but I will come back and document this in the future.

No O-Grids:
    I am unsure of this setting at the current time, but I will come back and document this in the future.

Allow stair-stepped meshing:
    This option enables and disables the ability for the mesher to create a stair-stepped mesh. My understanding of this is that,
    in extreme cases, your mesh can look like it was built from voxels, like in Minecraft.

Multi level meshing
    I am unsure of these settings at the current time, but I will come back and document this in the future.

Defaults
