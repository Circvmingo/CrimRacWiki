Modifiers
=========
Modifiers are applied on top of an existing mesh and change various aspects of the mesh, with the benefit of modifiers being a
non-destructive form of modeling.

Though there are quite a few modifiers available, only a few get used frequently. For this reason, this documentation will only cover
those frequently used modifiers.



Generation
----------

Array
^^^^^
The array modifier allows you to create a 2D array of the selected object. It allows you to choose between a set length, a curve to
follow, or just simple offsets.

Bevel
^^^^^
The bevel modifier allows you to non-destructively bevel the edges of objects.

Boolean
^^^^^^^
The boolean modifier is best used through the blender addon "Bool-Tool", but the modifier enables non-destructive creation of holes in
objects.

Decimate
^^^^^^^^
The decimate modifier lets you control the mesh resolution. This is most often used if you have no need for a high resolution model,
but the imported file is absolutely ridiculous.
