Primitives
==========
The primitives are what we call the building blocks of a model. They offer a starting point from which to build your model from, and
each has its own pros and cons.

.. note:: The primitives can be found by pressing Shift+A in the viewport, under Mesh.

The Plane
---------

Good as a flat ground, or a wall. Needs to be heavily modified to be super interesting, but it definitely has its purposes in the
creation process.

The Cube
--------

Literally the best primitive there is. It's all quads, and 3D. This is the primitive I would reccomend using for just about everything.
Just make sure to delete the default one, it's cursed. I don't make the rules, sorry.

The Circle
----------

I rarely use the circle. It just makes a ring of points and then fills it in. I'm sure it has some very good uses, but I can't think of
many.


The UV Sphere
-------------

It's a sphere made mostly of squares, and is pretty nice all around. I don't use spheres super often, so I don't have a super strong
opinion about these.

The Ico-Sphere
--------------

I like using the Ico-sphere for non-sphere related activities, such as making dice with them or making crystals.

The Cylinder
------------

The second best primitive behind the cube. I know it's not broken up nicely into quads, but I do use it frequently and often so it's
hard to complain.

The Cone
--------

I rarely use the cone. if I need a cone shaped object, I'll use the cylinder and deform it until it looks like a cone. The geometry
of a cone often causes a lot of problems, especially when trying to bevel edges.


The Torus
---------

The torus has very niche applications, but I'm very grateful for it when I run into one of those situations.

The Monkey

Her name is Suzanne and you will show her respect.
