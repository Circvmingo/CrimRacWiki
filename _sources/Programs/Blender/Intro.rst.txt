Intro to Polygon-Based Modeling
===============================

As stated on the main page, Blender is a polygon-based modeling software. It doesn't need to be as precise as Solidworks or Fusion 360,
because it doesn't have to be. That's not its purpose. Instead of defining everything by functions and operations, an object is made up
of vertices, lines, and faces. 2 vertices make up a line, 3 or more lines make up a face, and 4 or more faces make a closed object.
These three things are the building blocks of the building blocks, and it is essential to understand how they like to behave so that you
can build models in a correct manner.


Connecting the three together
-----------------------------
Though you are able to build models in pretty much any way you see fit, there are a few generally accepted guidelines regarding how a
bunch of vertices should be connected together.

`This website <https://artisticrender.com/triangles-vs-quads-in-blender/#:~:text=When%20we%20say%20tris%20in,block%20of%20any%203D%20mesh.>`_
explains this topic much better, and goes more in depth into the reasoning for everything.

Quads
^^^^^
Making a model through the use of quads is the best way of modeling, bar none. In this method, 4 vertices are connected by 4 edges,
making 1 face. By taking the time to model using this method, you will almost always save time later down the road when performing more
complex operations on your mesh. Additionally, your mesh will be easier to work with and look at, even in the early stages of modeling.
However, there are cases in which a quad can't quite do its job right. That's where triangles come in.

Tris
^^^^
One method of joining things together nicely is through tris, or triangles. In this layout, three vertices are connected by three edges.
No more, No less. They're great for when a mesh might be too complex for to be made from quads, or when you need just a little more
detail in a specific spot. However, these should be avoided at almost all other instances. I will be the first to admit that this is
very difficult to do, but with the amount of headaches I have caused myself due to poor modeling technique, it really is worth it in the
end to do things the right way.

N-Gons and Poles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Both N-gons and poles should be avoided at almost all opportunities. An N-Gon is a face with more than 4 edges, and a pole is a vertex
with more than 4 connected edges. These are both best avoided for the same reasons as triangles, and can cause serious issues later down
the line when texturing or editing models.
