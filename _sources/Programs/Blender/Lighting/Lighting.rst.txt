Lighting
========

Lighting is a tricky thing to teach, as it is more artistic than scientific. There is no right or wrong way to do it, but some ways
are definitely better than others.

Back to Basics
--------------
To provide a foundation in lighting a scene in 3D art, we should probably start back at stage lighting. Because I started here, I know
of no other point from which to start. However, almost all of the information for stage lighting is relevant here as well.

Purpose of Lighting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Angles of Lighting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
When attempting to light an actor on stage, the location of the light is critical to its purpose. For instance, if you put a light in
front of the person, they will be lit(shocker, I know). But what happens when you put a light behind them? Suddenly, instead of creating
a character on stage which is bright and welcoming, you have cast the actor in shadows and made them into a mysterious evil. Listed
below are some of the most often used angles in lighting design to give a visual example of just how important the location of a light
is, but this does not mean that they are the only ones you can use! Do what is best for the scene, and what portrays and enhances the
acting in the most appropriate manner.

Controllable Properties
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Lights, both in real life and in digital art can be controlled in many different ways. However, for our purposes we are most interested
in the color of the light, the intensity of the light, and the sharpness of the light.
