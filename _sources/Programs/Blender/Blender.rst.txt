Blender
=======

Blender is a polygon-based modeling software which can be used to create anything from massive photorealistic landscapes to small,
low-poly baskets, and everything in between. The main advantage that Blender has over Solidworks is that Blender has the ability to
render images *really* well. The drawback of Blender, though, is that the whole software is based around polygons. This means that
if you want a circle, you're kind of SOL. Of course, you can always approximate to the best of your ability, but it will never be
perfect. Additionally, the more geometry you put into a file, the worse the performance of the file will be. At the end of the day,
it's all a trade off.

I started learning Blender at the beginning of the pandemic some time around March 2020, on my school computer because I was bored and
had nothing better to do, I guess. I've always had a love for making things, and a software like Blender meant that I could create
anything that came to my head, without cost or fear of not having the right tools. The only issue was that I had ZERO idea what I was
doing, meaning I needed a tutorial. Because I'm a sentimental idiot, I'm going to link the tutorial that I learned from initially, way
back when. Of course, Blender has changed **A LOT** since BlenderGuru released that tutorial. Features were added, render engines were
optimized, techniques changed and got more efficient. With all of that said though, the fundimentals taught in the series of videos
still hold true.

Below I have attached several renders of mine I have made throughout the years. This is not to discourage you, but instead encourage you
and show how linearly your improvement can be if you just stick with it a little bit.

Donut tutorial!!

.. image:: DemoImages/SecondRender.png

This is my second render. Regressing at first is okay!

.. image:: DemoImages/ThreeDaysLater.png

Only 3 days later, I made this. Still proud of it today.

.. image:: DemoImages/MyDesk.png

Eventually, I began making renders of everything in my house. Here's my desk.

.. image:: DemoImages/LowPolyHard.png

Low poly art is hard. I still to this day struggle with it.

.. image:: DemoImages/AfterBlock.png

For a while, I had severe creativity block. This is the first render I made after that hit. It's okay to take breaks!

.. image:: DemoImages/OneYear.png

One Year after it all started!! After this I really took off with Blender, and now the sky is the limit pretty much. I still
get humbled frequently, but I'd like to think my most recent works are pretty high quality.
